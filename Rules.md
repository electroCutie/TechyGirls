# Welcome to Techy Girls

Techy Girls is a safe space for women and especially survivors of sexual abuse. We welcome all women (cis or trans), non-binary and/or genderfluid people.

All of Our Chats are Places of Cooperation and Kindness, so please familiarise yourself with these shared rules:

* Be Kind
* You will not be called out or punished for bringing concerns to the moderators or admins. If you have a problem or need to discuss something that is making you uncomfortable, please don't hesitate
* Avoid unnecessary negativity. For example:
  * Don't tell someone that their tool of choice sucks. You don't like it, apparently for a reason. Share your reasons if you must but it is rarely the case that something is entirely bad
  * When people are helping each other that is a time to be constructive. They probably don't want to change distros or learn a new programming language. Try to see if your insights can help, but try to understand their needs and limitations
  * Be sure you understand why someone disagrees with you. It never hurt to ask for more information
  * Agree when you agree. Where there is common ground be sure to point it out, its usually a good starting point

## The chats

The Techy Girls community consists of 3 separate chats. Each of these chats have their own, additional rules.

### Techy Girls (G-Rated / E for Everyone)
The Rated G chat is a place with no sex and safe from triggers.

* The chat is not just SFW, but also sex-free. That means no references to sex, sexual organs, or sexual content, not even obliquely or medically
* If you find yourself trying to phrase something so as to be acceptable, that is a sign it is **not** okay
* Keep discussions about medical treatments to a mimimum. Talking about health and transition is more than okay, but shy away from specifics

An analogy to aid understanding is to think of a chat for people who are recovering from substance abuse
In that chat they do not allow any mention of intoxicants, intoxication, or even hinting at those things. This helps the members of the chat not focus on their addictions
*G-Rated / E for Everyone* is exactly that but for sex

### [18+] Techy Girls (NSFW-ish)
This chat is labeled NSFW-ish due to its looser ruleset, but it is not for porn. You must be at least 18 years old to join this chat.

* The chat is NSFW but is not for sexually explicit content, There is a chat specifically for that. No porn and no descriptions of sexual acts
* The chat may sometimes contain hard or potentially triggering topics, as such they will be approached with the maturity and delicacy that they deserve

### [18+] Smutty Girls
Rules are kept separately [here](./SmuttyRules.md)
